# Context

In this project I focused on analysing factors which has influence on happiness and overall well-being from 2015 until 2023. I tried to compare factors like happiness scores, GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption between continents. The data comes from Kaggle, using their API. The significance of this research lies in its potential to offer nuanced insights into the evolving dynamics of global happiness. By exploring the interplay between social and economic indicators, individual freedoms, and societal perceptions, this project makes a meaningful contribution to the larger discussion about the quality of life.
